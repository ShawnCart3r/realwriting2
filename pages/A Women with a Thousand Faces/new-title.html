                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Chains clinked against the cold, unforgiving concrete walls of the barren room. Moonlight trickled through two narrow, barred windows, casting jagged shadows that seemed to move as the light shifted. The air was damp and stale, with the faint smell of rust and mildew hanging in it. Every sound echoed, making the space feel even more desolate. My prisoner lay sprawled on the floor, her form small against the vast, empty room. One of her wrists was chained to the wall—not that she could escape even if it weren’t. She wasn’t going anywhere.

                       
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I had been watching her for hours through the hidden camera. The sedative would wear off soon. I leaned in closer, waiting. Erica stirred, her eyelids fluttering as she blinked into the dim light, disoriented. I let the moment stretch, watching as confusion began to set in.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        She shifted, struggling to sit up, her breath hitching as the cold metal of the chain pressed into her wrist. “Where am I?” she whispered, her voice groggy and weak. She rubbed her eyes, trying to clear her head, her movements slow and sluggish from the drugs.
 

                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I stayed silent, letting her mind catch up. The tension in her body built slowly as she became aware of the chain, pulling at it tentatively. Her breathing quickened. “No, no…” she muttered, her voice shaking, barely audible. She scanned the room, panic taking hold. But there was nothing—just concrete and shadows.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        “Help!” she cried out, her voice cracking. “Someone! Help me!” The echo of her words faded into the emptiness. There was no one. No one who could hear her.

                        
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I got up, finally giving in. Watching from the shadows was fun, but this was the part I had been waiting for. I moved to the door, opening it just enough to step in. Erica froze, her breathing shallow. Her wide eyes darted to the door, and her grip on the chain tightened.

                       

                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        “Who’s there?” Her voice trembled, but she tried to sound strong. Tried to take control of something she couldn’t.

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I stepped forward slowly, keeping to the edge of the room where the shadows clung to me. “Just me,” I said, my voice calm. “No need to freak out.”
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        She squinted, trying to see through the darkness. “Who… who are you?” Her voice wavered, betraying the fear she was trying to hold down. “Why am I here?”
 
                        
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I let out a small sigh, leaning against the wall. “Come on, Erica. You know who I am.”

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Her brow furrowed, confusion rippling across her face. “What are you talking about? I’ve never seen you before.”
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I stepped into a sliver of moonlight, just enough for her to see my face. “Haven’t you?”

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Her eyes widened, her mouth opening slightly as she stared. She looked at me—no, at my face—and then at her own reflection in the small window above. The resemblance was unmistakable. Her breath caught. “What is this?” she whispered, barely getting the words out.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I shrugged, moving closer. “You know exactly what this is. We both can’t be here, Erica.”
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        She backed up, pressing herself against the wall, eyes darting toward the door. “No, wait… you don’t have to do this,” she stammered, desperation seeping into her voice. “We can work something out. Please. I won’t tell anyone. I swear.” She tried to sound convincing, but I could hear the terror in her words.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I raised an eyebrow, looking at her, pretending to consider it. “That’s cute. But you’re not the quiet type, are you? I know how curious you are. You wouldn’t be able to help yourself.”

                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Her breath quickened as I moved closer. “I—I could disappear. No one would ever know. Please, I’ll do whatever you want.” 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I stood over her, my shadow casting a long shape across her face. “I’m sure you would.” I pulled out the pistol from behind my back, the metal cold against my palm. Her eyes locked onto it, and her body tensed. “But we both know how this ends.”
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        “Please…” she whispered, tears welling in her eyes, her voice breaking as she stared up at me.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">I looked down at her, feeling the weight of the silence between us. I pressed the barrel against her forehead, my voice soft. “I’m sorry. But I’ll take good care of your life. You have my word.”</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">“How was your weekend, Erica?” Dr. Josephine asked, stepping into the lab with a stack of files in her arms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">I looked up from my desk, giving her a bright smile. “It was good, actually. I feel… better.”</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">“Glad to hear it! I always say, sometimes a break is all you need to feel like a whole new person.” She grinned, oblivious. “Ready for another busy week?”</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I nodded, shuffling the papers in front of me. “Definitely. I’m ready for anything.”
                   
                          
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        And I was.
